# Computer Network Security Analysis and Threat Detection System Design

This is my thesis for the Computer Engineering and Informatics department of the University of Patras.
Its about network security and cyberattacks, what is the danger and how to prevent them as network administrators as well as informations that help users to be more protected while navigating the internet and network engineers to build a more secure and overall better network.
Here i provide the python scripts i coded for the practical part of my thesis where i built a network using virtual machines. There are two types of scripts.
The first type of scripts is to be used by the network administrator. With them he can check if all the machines, that are supposed to be connected to his network, actually respond to his requests, and the other one where he leaves running in the background monitoring the traffic silently and will show a warning if an IP, that is not supposed to be in his network, starts using it.
The second type of scripts is to be used by a malicious user who is infiltrated inside a network. With them he can monitor the traffic, sniff the packets that are sent between machines and steal the IPs of the network which later he can use, along side with a command, to DDoS the network and create chaos inside it.
